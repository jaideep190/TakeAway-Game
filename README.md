## Introduction to Sprague-Grundy Strategy:

The Sprague-Grundy theory, also known as the theory of impartial games, is a mathematical concept used in game theory to analyze and determine optimal strategies in two-player games. It applies to games where players take turns making moves and neither player has an inherent advantage based on the position of the game alone.

The key idea behind the Sprague-Grundy strategy is to assign a numerical value, called the Grundy number, to each possible game position. These numbers represent the "nimber" of a position, indicating its game-theoretical value. The Grundy number is calculated recursively based on the Grundy numbers of the positions resulting from possible moves.

## Applying Sprague-Grundy Strategy to Take Away Sticks:

In the Take Away Sticks game, players start with a certain number of sticks, and on each turn, a player can choose to remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks. The player who removes the last stick wins the game.

To apply the Sprague-Grundy strategy to this game, we first need to calculate the Grundy numbers for different numbers of sticks remaining. We can then use these Grundy numbers to determine the optimal move in any given position.

## Calculating Grundy Numbers:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If there are no sticks left (i.e., the game is over), the Grundy number is 0.
   - If there is only one stick left, the Grundy number is 1.

2. **Recursive Calculation:**
   - For any other number of sticks, we calculate the Grundy number based on the Grundy numbers of positions resulting from possible moves.
   - Specifically, for each possible move (1, 2, or 3 sticks), we calculate the Grundy number of the resulting position.
   - The Grundy number of the current position is the smallest non-negative integer that is not equal to the Grundy number of any resulting position.

## Using Grundy Numbers to Determine Moves:

Once we have calculated the Grundy numbers for different positions, we can use them to determine the optimal move in any given position. The optimal move is the one that leads to a position with a Grundy number of 0, if possible. If there are no such moves, we can choose any move that leads to a position with the smallest Grundy number.

## Implementation in the Game:

In the Python implementation of the Take Away Sticks game, the `calculate_grundy` function calculates the Grundy number for a given number of sticks. The `computer_move` function uses the calculated Grundy numbers to determine the computer's move, ensuring it plays optimally according to the Sprague-Grundy strategy.

## Conclusion:

The Sprague-Grundy strategy provides a systematic approach to analyzing and determining optimal strategies in impartial games like Take Away Sticks. By calculating Grundy numbers and using them to guide gameplay decisions, players can make informed moves and strive for victory.
